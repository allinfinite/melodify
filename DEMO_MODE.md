# ðŸŽ­ Enhanced Demo Mode

Since Suno API is currently unavailable, here's a better demo experience:

## What We Can Do

### Option 1: Realistic Demo with Sample Music

I can create a demo mode that:
1. Takes your voice recording
2. Plays a pre-made sample track (not AI, but demonstrates the concept)
3. Shows what the final result would look like

### Option 2: Video/Audio Samples

Add sample remixes to show users what to expect:
- Pre-recorded examples of each style
- "Before" (voice only) and "After" (with music) comparisons

### Option 3: Better Mock with Audio Processing

Add basic audio processing to mock mode:
- Add reverb/echo to voice
- Mix with public domain instrumentals
- Simple equalization

## Quick Implementation

Want me to:
1. **Add sample audio files** for each style (Pop, Rock, Jazz, etc.)
2. **Create a better demo mode** that uses these samples
3. **Show "example results"** instead of just returning voice

This way users can see the concept while waiting for Suno API!

## Or Just Wait?

Alternatively:
- Add a banner: "AI Service temporarily unavailable"
- Disable the "Generate" button with explanation
- Let users know when to try again

What would you prefer?
