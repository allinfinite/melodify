# 🎙️ Recording Cutoff Issue - FIXED

## Problem
Audio recordings were only capturing ~0.5 seconds and cutting off early.

## Root Cause
The recorder was using `mediaRecorder.start(100)` which:
- Requests data chunks every 100ms
- Can cause the browser to finalize the recording early
- Sometimes drops the last chunks

## Fix Applied

Changed the recording strategy:
- ✅ Use `mediaRecorder.start()` without timeslice
- ✅ Call `requestData()` before stopping
- ✅ Wait 100ms for data to be collected
- ✅ Better validation (min 1 second, 1000 bytes)

## 🧪 Test Now

**Restart your server:**
```bash
# Stop (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**Then test:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/record
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Speak for 5-10 seconds
4. Click "Stop Recording"
5. Play back the recording

**Check console logs:**
You should see:
```
Recording started, MIME type: audio/webm
Audio chunk received: XXXX bytes
Stopping recording, duration: 5 seconds
Recording stopped, total chunks: 1
Total audio data: XXXX bytes
Created blob: XXXX bytes
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior

- **Duration**: Full recording length (5-10 seconds)
- **File size**: Several KB (not just a few bytes)
- **Playback**: Complete audio, not just half a second

## 🔍 Debug Info

If still cutting off, check the console for:
- "Recording too short" = Less than 1 second
- "Total audio data: X bytes" = Should be > 10,000 for a few seconds
- Number of chunks = Should be 1 or more

## 💡 Browser-Specific

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Should work perfectly now
- Uses Opus codec in WebM

**Firefox:**
- Should also work
- May use different codec

**Safari:**
- WebM not fully supported
- May need to use file upload instead

## Alternative: File Upload

If recording still doesn't work:
1. Use your phone or computer's voice recorder
2. Save as MP3 or WAV
3. Click "Upload Audio File" instead
4. Works every time!

**The fix is in place - try recording again!** 🎵
