---

### Step 6: Get Your URL

🔗 https://melodify-abc123.vercel.app
```

**This is your public URL!**

---

## 🧪 Test Your Deployed App

### 1. Open Your Vercel URL

Visit: `https://melodify-abc123.vercel.app` (use your actual URL)

### 2. Generate Music

1. **Record/upload** voice
2. **Select a style**
3. **Click "Generate My Remix"**

### 3. Watch It Work!

Now the uploadUrl will be:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check:** 
- Are all dependencies in `package.json`?
- Does `npm run build` work locally?

**Fix:** Run locally first:
```bash
npm run build
```

Fix any errors, then push again.

---

### "Can't fetch uploaded audio" Still

**Check:** 
- Is the deployment successful?
- Can you access `https://your-url.vercel.app/uploads/test.txt` ?

**Note:** Vercel's `/public` folder becomes the root in production.

---

### Audio Files Not Accessible

**Issue:** Vercel is serverless - files uploaded at runtime don't persist.

**Solution (if needed):** Use cloud storage:
- AWS S3
- Cloudinary
- Vercel Blob

But for testing, it should work since:
1. User uploads audio
2. Gets saved to `/public/uploads`
3. SunoAPI.org downloads it immediately
4. File is only needed for ~2 minutes

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (follow steps above)
2. **Test generation** with your Vercel URL
3. **Share your app!** Your Vercel URL is publicly accessible

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Custom Domain

Want `melodify.yourdomain.com`?

1. Go to project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your domain
4. Update DNS records

---
